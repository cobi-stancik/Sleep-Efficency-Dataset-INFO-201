**Load the sleep data into Rmarkdown using the read.csv function.**

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
sleep <- read_delim("data/Sleep_Efficiency.csv")
sleep %>%
  head(4)
```

```{r}
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = `Sleep duration`, y = `Sleep efficiency`)) +
  geom_point(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(x = "Sleep duration", y = "Sleep Efficiency") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(sleep, aes(x = `Sleep efficiency`, y = `REM sleep percentage`)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Sleep Efficiency", y = "REM Sleep Percentage")
```



Visualize the sleep efficiency rating using a histogram or other appropriate plot.

Provide a written explanation of your methodology and findings, including any insights you gained from analyzing the data.
